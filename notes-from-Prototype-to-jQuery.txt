This text holds thoughts on migrating Concrete from Prototype to jQuery.

* Prototype and jQuery are quite different: the former is mostly a framework to provide
	some niceties on top of core/bare JavaScript while the latter is mostly a framework
	to help with developing a HTML5(-like) UI.

* Prototype works predominantly by adding methods to object's prototypes - hence the name (dûh!).
	This pollutes these objects a bit. It also means that it's easy to use Prototype's
	collection-type functions, with a pleasing syntax to boot.

* Concrete uses Prototype's Class.create({}) heavily. There's no equivalent construct in jQuery,
	so this would need to be ported "down" to regular JavaScript. This has the advantage that
	we can specify visibility of members (functions):
	public (probably none) vs. privileged (functions only) vs. private.
	This also allows us to do real encapsulation - i.e., without having to rely on the '_'-prefix
	convention.
	(Note that an 'initialize' function is effectively transformed into a constructor by Class.create({}.)

* Before actually migrating it's probably a good idea to Refactor the existing code base
	to be a bit more orthogonal and smaller.
